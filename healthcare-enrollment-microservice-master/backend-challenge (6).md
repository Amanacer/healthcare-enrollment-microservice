# Hi there! 🐱‍🏍

We're excited for you to be taking our coding challenge! 

# The challenge

Using Spring Boot or Go, and your database of choice (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB -- any you'd like), develop a microservice for tracking the status of enrollees in a health care program.
- Enrollees must have an id, name, and activation status (true or false), and a birth date
- Enrollees may have a phone number (although they do not have to supply this)
- Enrollees may have zero or more dependents
- Each of an enrollee's dependents must have an id, name, and birth date

The application we will be building will need to be able to do these things:
- Add a new enrollee 
- Modify an existing enrollee
- Remove an enrollee entirely
- Add dependents to an enrollee
- Remove dependents from an enrollee
- Modify existing dependents


👉 _Treat this code as if it were being deployed in production to be maintained by a team of developers._ 

The rest is up to you! There is no "correct" solution here. Reach into your bag of your tricks and do what you love to do!

You got this! 💪

**💰BONUS CHALLENGE**💰: If you chose Spring Boot, can you also write this service in Go? If you chose Go, can you write it in Spring Boot?

# Submitting your code
Please create a new repo under your personal github account for this code and send it our way when you're all done!
